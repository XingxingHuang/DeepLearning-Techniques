# DeepLearning-Techniques

## Models
**YOLO**	<https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/>

**R-CNN** Object detection in a larger size image.

**Fast R-CNN** Spatial Pyramid Pooling, ROI Pooling

**Faster R-CNN** Use Region Proposal Network to propose boxes/regions.

**SSD** fast, but not good as YOLO

## Techniques

**Spatial Pyramid Pooling** deal with different size inputs

**Region of Interested Pooling** ROI pooling. share features by combine the bbox regression and CNN.

**Region Proposal Network**

**Focal Loss** Use modulating factor to change the increase the weight for hard classes. Minor improvement. [Investigating Focal and Dice Loss for the Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl](https://becominghuman.ai/investigating-focal-and-dice-loss-for-the-kaggle-2018-data-science-bowl-65fb9af4f36c)

## Problems in DL

**Imbalance** Only part of the image contains the target.
